            <p>The game begins with Chell waking up from a stasis bed and hearing instructions from GLaDOS, an artificial intelligence,
            about upcoming tests. Chell enters into sequential distinct chambers that introduce her to varying challenges to solve
            using her portal gun, with GLaDOS as her only interaction.</p>
